      "body": "<p>The COVID-19 IgG/IgM (Whole Blood/Serum/Plasma) Rapid Test Device utilizes lateral flow technology for the qualitative, differential detection of both anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. In general, antibodies can be detected 1-3 weeks after infection. This test is intended to screen patients for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. </p> <p>Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that are distributed broadly among humans, other mammals and birds that cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurologic diseases. Four viruses - 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 are prevalent and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompromised individuals. Three other strains SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) can be transmitted from between non-human vertebrates to humans.</p> <p><strong>Warning: </strong>This test has been authorized by FDA under an EUA for use by authorized laboratories. This test has not been FDA cleared or approved. This test has been authorized only for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens. This test is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E. This product is intended for professional use and not for home use. Not for the screening of donated blood.</p>"

COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infectious disease. Currently, individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 are the main source of transmission; asymptomatic carriers are also known as a source of transmission. Based on the current epidemiological information, the incubation period can last from 1 to 14 days, where the average time before symptoms occur is about 5 days. Symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea.</p> <p><strong>Not for sale within the US.
